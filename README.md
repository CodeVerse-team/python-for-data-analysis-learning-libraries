# 🐍 Python for Data Analysis Learning Libraries

**Data Analysis | Learnings | Libraries | Projects**

This repository documents my continuous learning journey through the essential Python libraries for Data Analysis. I focus on practical application of tools like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn** to transform raw data into actionable insights.

## 📚 Learning Modules and Libraries

The core modules below cover fundamental concepts in data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis. Each folder contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) detailing the theory and implementation.

### 1. NumPy (Numerical Python)

This module explores the foundation of scientific computing in Python, focusing on efficient array operations.

| Notebook | Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Numpy Arrays.ipynb` | Core concepts of NumPy arrays, indexing, and basic operations. |
| `Reading_CSV_and_Plotting.ipynb` | Initial data loading from CSV and basic plotting techniques using NumPy (and possibly an introductory visualization library). |

### 2. Pandas

Pandas is the workhorse of data analysis, centered around the powerful DataFrame structure.

| Notebook | Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Data Frames in Pandas.ipynb` | Understanding and creating DataFrames, essential indexing, and selection methods. |
| `Pandas Learnings.ipynb` | Various data manipulation and aggregation techniques using Pandas functions. |

### 3. Data Cleaning

A critical step in the Data Analysis process. This module focuses on preparing real-world data for analysis.

| Notebook | Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| `[Data Cleaning 1] Missing Data.ipynb` | Identifying and handling null/missing values in datasets. |
| `[Data Cleaning 2] Handling Missing Data.ipynb` | Advanced strategies for imputing or dropping missing data. |
| `[Data Cleaning 3] Not Null Values.ipynb` | Techniques for verifying data quality and ensuring required fields are present. |
| `[Data Cleaning 4] More Visualization.ipynb` | Using visualization to identify and clean outliers and anomalies. |
| `[Data Cleaning 5] Real World Example.ipynb` | Applying a complete cleaning workflow to a complex dataset. |
| `[Data Cleaning 6] Reading CSV files.ipynb` | Loading and initial inspection of data from CSV files. |
| `[Data Cleaning 7] Reading SQL, HTML, Excel, Etc.ipynb` | Importing data from various sources (databases, web tables, spreadsheets). |

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Python

This module covers the process of examining datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.

| Folder | Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python` | Initial steps in analyzing data, generating statistical summaries, and visualizing distributions to understand patterns. |
